Log in with a Github OAuth token we audit your permissions

- Web app vs. OAuth token
  - should this be a sleek webapp or really just a service
    - service to start, can always have a frontend later
  - start with personal access token for prototyping

- If the user disables certain permissions (scopes) for `perm`, do we know?
- What relevant information can `perm` get, assuming full scope access?
    - list user authorized oauth grants
