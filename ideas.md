Log in with a Github OAuth token we audit your permissions

- Web app vs. OAuth token
  - should this be a sleek webapp or really just a service
    - service to start, can always have a frontend later

- What relevant information can _perm_ get, assuming full scope access?
    - list user authorized oauth grants
